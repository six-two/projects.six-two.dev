<h2 class="section-header" id="react_payload_builder">Payload Builder</h2>
A simple web application that can be used to create attack strings for buffer overflow / format string attacks.
Since it is my first JavaScript/TypeScript/React project the code may not be pretty ;D

Both [source code]({{ site.baseurl_source }}react_payload_builder) and
[hosted version]({{ site.baseurl_hosted }}react_payload_builder) are available.
