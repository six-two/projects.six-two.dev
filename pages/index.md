<h2 class="section-header" id="react_payload_builder">Personal websites</h2>
Static websites built with Jekyll and hosted by Github / Gitlab Pages:

- [My website](https://six-two.dev) and its [source code]({{ site.baseurl_my_gitlab }}six-two.gitlab.io)
- [My projects website (this website)]({{ site.baseurl_hosted }}) and its [source code]({{ site.baseurl_my_github }}six-two.github.io)

<h2 class="section-header" id="react_payload_builder">Payload Builder</h2>
A simple web application that can be used to create attack strings for buffer overflow / format string attacks.
Since it is my first JavaScript/TypeScript/React project the code may not be pretty ;D

Both [source code]({{ site.baseurl_my_github }}react_payload_builder) and
[hosted version]({{ site.baseurl_hosted }}react_payload_builder) are available.
